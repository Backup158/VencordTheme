# What is This
Uploaded so I can sorta sync my setup for dual booting. Setting up all the plugins every time is tedious when I have to update things every few years (and in case of data loss but shush). I have Discord on a vertical monitor and only use dark mode.

# Vencord Theme
Uses [Discord+](https://plusinsta.github.io/discord-plus/) by PlusInsta with some color/image choices.

With additions from the Vencord community in #css-snippets. Mostly to hide things. 

The QuickCSS file in this repo includes a bunch of backgrounds I've cycled through. Choose whichever one fits the mood.

# Plugins

Json file includes the plugins and QuickCSS links.

# Usage
THEME ONLY: Idk how to actually make a theme with all these snippets so just put `@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Backup158/VencordTheme/refs/heads/main/quickcssSettings.css")` in the QuickCSS Editor lol

THE WHOLE SHEBANG: Download the json file and import it by going into Settings -> Vencord -> Backup and Restore -> Import Settings
