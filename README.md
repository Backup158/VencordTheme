# Vencord Theme
Based on [Discord+](https://plusinsta.github.io/discord-plus/) by PlusInsta

With additions from the Vencord community in #css-snippets. Mostly to hide things. I have Discord on a vertical monitor and only use dark mode. 

# Plugins

Json file includes the plugins and QuickCSS links.

# Usage
THEME ONLY: Idk how to actually make a theme with all these snippets so just put `@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Backup158/VencordTheme/refs/heads/main/quickcssSettings.css")` in the QuickCSS Editor lol

THE WHOLE SHEBANG: Download the json file and import it by going into Settings -> Vencord -> Backup and Restore -> Import Settings
