# What Is This?
Uploaded so I can sync my [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) setup for dual booting. Setting up all the plugins every time is tedious when I have to update things every few years (and in case of data loss). I have Discord on a vertical monitor and only use dark mode, so that's what the settings are tailored towards.

# Vencord Theme
Uses [Discord+](https://plusinsta.github.io/discord-plus/) by PlusInsta with some color/image choices.

With additions from the Vencord community, generally taken from **#css-snippets**. Mostly to hide things. 

The [theme file in this repo](https://github.com/Backup158/VencordTheme/blob/main/DiscordPlusChunky.theme.css) includes a bunch of backgrounds I've cycled through. Choose whichever one fits the mood (or add your own).

# Plugins

Plugin settings are included in the [Vencord settings backup file](https://github.com/Backup158/VencordTheme/blob/main/vencord-settings-backup.json) in this repo. Setting this will also automatically setup the theme for you.

# Usage
THEME ONLY: _Settings_ -> _Vencord_ -> _Themes_ -> _Online Themes_ -> Type `@dark https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Backup158/VencordTheme/refs/heads/main/DiscordPlusChunky.theme.css`

THE WHOLE SHEBANG: Download the json file and import it by going into _Settings_ -> _Vencord_ -> _Backup and Restore_ -> _Import Settings_
